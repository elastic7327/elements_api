##The Task
Because of the CSV potentially being moved to another location on another server or maybe being replaced by another source entirely, an API should be implemented in between. 
Build a RESTful JSON API in Python/Django that will load the contents of the CSV and transforms this into a structure that will be used by the mobile application.
Things you have to take into consideration:

Application structure;
Performance;
Image cache;
Exception handling;
Working in a DTAP (Development/Testing/Acceptance/Production) environment.
Optional Components:
Response cache;
Scalability, when the application should be served from multiple servers.

##Remarks
You can build everything yourself or use existing library components. This is mainly a test to see how you would implement a development challenge.
Try to make error handling as graceful as possible. The user should not be bugged with error messages.
Good luck!
